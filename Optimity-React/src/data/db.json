Users can access their familiar desktop environment with all their applications, data, and settings intact, boosting productivity and reducing the learning curve for new technologies. VDI technology not only benefits end users but also serves as a significant cost-saving measure: Since the majority of processing in VDI is server-based, there’s no need for costly or advanced hardware. Access to VDI can be achieved through an affordable thin client, which could be a repurposed old PC, thereby extending its lifespan. This reduces the need for IT to make numerous new purchases or significant budget adjustments." ,
